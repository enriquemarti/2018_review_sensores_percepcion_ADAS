% Abstract (Do not use inserted blank lines, i.e. \\) 
\abstract{
    20+ years of research on ADAS, Level 2-3 systems already commercially available. Automated Driving still in research phase, but with several companies working towards commercial platforms. These systems are based on the input provided by a set of sensors, which allow to describe the state of the vehicle, its environment and other actors. Innovation comes in two ways: new sensing technologies that overcome existing perception limitations and processing/fusion algorithms that transform raw data into more complete, accurate and meaningful information. This survey reviews existing and upcoming sensor solutions applied to ADAS/Automated Driving, based in both well known and novel sensing technologies. They are put in historical context reviewing the sensing setup of relevant demonstrators developed by academic and public institutions. Finally, the article presents a snapshot of current situation in commercial/industrial  applications by identifying most relevant manufacturers and company alliances towards Automated Driving.}
%    A single paragraph of about 200 words maximum. For research articles, abstracts should give a pertinent overview of the work. We strongly encourage authors to use the following style of structured abstracts, but without headings: 1) Background: Place the question addressed in a broad context and highlight the purpose of the study; 2) Methods: Describe briefly the main methods or treatments applied; 3) Results: Summarize the article's main findings; and 4) Conclusion: Indicate the main conclusions or interpretations. The abstract should be an objective representation of the article, it must not contain results which are not presented and substantiated in the main text and should not exaggerate the main conclusions.}

% Keywords
\keyword{keyword 1; keyword 2; keyword 3 (list three to ten pertinent keywords specific to the article, yet reasonably common within the subject discipline.)}

%The appendix is an optional section that can contain details and data supplemental to the main text. For example, explanations of experimental details that would disrupt the flow of the main text, but nonetheless remain crucial to understanding and reproducing the research shown; figures of replicates for experiments of which representative data is shown in the main text can be added here if brief, or as Supplementary data. Mathematical proofs of results not central to the paper can be added as an appendix.
